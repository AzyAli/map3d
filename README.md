## About The Project

This is a 3D building mapping service implemented with [React-Three-Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). It allows exporting as a GLB file, and all features are free to use. Based on this project, various functionalities such as **digital twin**, **drone surveying**, and **GPS markers** can be implemented.

The map files are based on OpenStreetMap data.
